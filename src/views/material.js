            Explanation: <br />
            Material-UI provides components like Button, TextField, AppBar, etc.
            You can easily use these components by importing them from the
            @mui/material library. Components come with default styles following
            the Material Design principles, but you can customize them to fit
            your application's design. <br /> <br /> Key Points: <br />
            Material-UI is a React UI framework that follows Google's Material
            Design principles. It provides a set of pre-designed and
            customizable components for building modern user interfaces.
            Components are easy to use, and you can import them directly from
            the Material-UI library. Material-UI also offers theming and styling
            options to match your application's look and feel. <br /> <br />
            In simple terms, Material-UI is a toolbox for React developers,
            offering a collection of ready-made components to quickly build a
            visually consistent and modern user interface in line with Material
            Design principles.
