            Scenario: <br />
            Imagine a situation where an event or action occurs in a child
            component, and you want to notify the parent component or pass some
            information back to it. <br />
            <br />
            Problem: <br />
            How do you communicate from a child component to its parent in
            React? Solution: Pass a function (callback) as a prop from the
            parent to the child. The child can then call this function to send
            data or notify the parent about an event.

        <Box>
          <Typography variant="h5" color="initial">
            Parent component:
          </Typography>
          <img src="image/child.png" />
          <br /> <br />
          <Typography variant="h5" color="initial">
            Child component:
          </Typography>
          <img src="image/child2.png" />

            Explanation: <br />
            The ParentComponent defines a state variable (dataFromChild) and a
            callback function (handleDataFromChild) to receive data from the
            child. The ChildComponent receives the callback function as a prop
            (sendDataToParent) from the parent. When an event occurs in the
            child (e.g., a button click), it calls the callback function with
            the data to be sent to the parent.
            <br />
            <br /> Key Points: Communication from child to parent is achieved by
            passing a callback function from the parent to the child as a prop.
            The child calls this callback function to send data or notify the
            parent about an event. This pattern enables a unidirectional flow of
            data in React, with data flowing from parent to child through props
            and from child to parent through callbacks. <br />
            <br />
            In simple terms, child-to-parent communication in React involves
            passing a callback function from the parent to the child as a prop.
            The child then uses this callback to send data or trigger actions in
            the parent component.
